Use grid to layout the design.

Check design principles and accessbility.

We will continue with this book blog in our next prove and will be adding more books and will bring in all the books dynamically with JavaScript. But this prove will just use static content for one book.

Visit this WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) to check your published site URL and correct any accessbility errors you might find.

Submit your project

Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes then check to make sure they show on Github pages.

After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:

 
https://githubusername.github.io/wdd131/blog
              
Make sure to replace "githubusername" with your actual github username.
